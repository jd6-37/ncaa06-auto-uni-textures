Use these textures for your source files in YOUR_TEXTURES_HERE for 
things like a white or gray facemask. Not only is this for convenience, 
but also because they are better than using exports from the TC Gear 
template – especially the facemasks – because the color has been 
fine tuned to make them look more realistic.
