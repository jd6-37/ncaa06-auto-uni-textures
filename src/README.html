        <h2 id="about">About</h2>
        <p>This utility is designed to assist in making uniforms for the NCAA NEXT mod's Uniform Expansion project. It significantly reduces the time required to create or update uniforms. It also catalogs the texture names in a CSV file and ensures that uniforms are structured in a standardized format.
        </p>
        <p>The utility operates in one of two modes:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mode 1 (CSV):</strong> Renames your custom uniform textures based on the texture names provided in a CSV file.</li>
          <li><strong>Mode 2 (DUMPS):</strong> Automatically searches through the dumps folder to find and rename the correct textures, while also cataloging them in a CSV file.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Mode 1 is automatically selected if there is a CSV file in the csv-override folder. If no CSV file is present, Mode 2 is automatically selected.</em></p>

        <p>Mode 2's image recognition feature means we no longer have to hunt for textures in the dumps folder and manually catalog textures names. With the renaming functionality of both modes, we never have to rename files by hand! ü•≥ This utility will do it all for you. Also to note: dumping and Mode 2 only ever needs to be done once per uniform. After a CSV file is created, the uniform never has to be dumped again! We only need to use the super-fast Mode 1 CSV renaming in the future. üëÄ</p>
        
        
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2 id="prep">PREPARING YOUR TEXTURES (For both renaming methods):</h2>
        <h3>STEP 1.</h3>
        <p>Copy all of the exported PNG files from the <strong>TC Gear</strong> template into the "<strong>YOUR_TEXTURES_HERE</strong>" folder.</p>
        <p class="note">‚ÑπÔ∏è NOTE: For common textures like a white or gray facemask or a white chinstrap, copy these from the 'default-textures' folder and overwrite the files you just put into YOUR_TEXTURES_HERE. In the case of a white chinstrap, this is easier than doing a whole new TC Gear export. Also, in the case of the facemasks, the colors have been fine tuned to make them look more realistic. A white facemask from a white TC Gear export will be too bright.</p>
        <h3>Step 1B. (only required for users of the LITE or XLITE TC Gear Template)</h3>
        <p>Create your <strong>shoe textures</strong> using the cleats template, rename them as below, and copy them into YOUR_TEXTURES_HERE, overwriting the existing files. This step is <strong>not</strong> required if you used the FULL version of the TC Gear template.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>16-Shoe.png</li>
            <li>17-Shoe_w_White_Tape.png</li>
            <li>23-Shoe_w_Black_Tape.png</li>
            <li>24-Shoe_w_TC_Tape.png</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>STEP 2.</h3>
        <p><strong>Put your other uniform pieces in the same folder.</strong> They must be named exactly as follows. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>helmet.png</strong></li>
            <li><strong>pants.png</strong></li>
            <li><strong>jersey.png</strong></li>
            <li><strong>num07.png</strong></li>
            <li><strong>num89.png</strong></li>
            <li>pridesticker.png * </li>
            <li>num07helmet.png ‚Ä†</li>
            <li>num89helmet.png ‚Ä†</li>
            <li>num07ss.png‚Ä†</li>
            <li>num89ss.png ‚Ä†</li>
            <li>glove.png ^</li>
            <li>glove-second.png ^^</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="optional">* optional, these can be transparented by the tool</p>

        <p class="optional">‚Ä† optional, and if no source texture is provided, the tool will use the main jersey numbers for 
          the helmet and/or sleeve/shoulders (this is usually what you want)</p>

        <p class="optional">^ optional, will be skipped if not provided</p>

        <p class="optional">^^ required only when the "Opposite Home/Away Glove" option is enabled. Use the same glove as glove.png,
          just duplicate the file and rename it to glove-second.png. More instructions below.</p>
        
        <h3>FILE PREP DONE!</h3>
        <p>Your textures are now ready for renaming!</p>

        <p><em>üß† TIP: I highly recommend saving a copy of this folder for later use. Call it, for example, "home-source" or "alt03-source". By having a copy of this folder for later use, it will save you from repeating all of the steps above if you ever want to make an edit to the uniform or move the uniform to a different slot.</em></p>

        <h2 id="mode1">INSTRUCTIONS (For Mode 1: CSV Renaming):</h2>
        <h3>STEP 1:</h3>
        <p>Put one CSV file in the csv-override folder. Make sure it is in the same format as csv-override-example.csv.</p>
        <h3>STEP 2:</h3>
        <p>Define your configuration settings based on the uniform slot and uniform design you are making. Hover over the labels for instructions. NOTE: The Team Name, Slot, and Uniform Type options are disabled because those are provided from the CSV.</p>
        <h3>STEP 3:</h3>
        <p>Click the "Rename Source Textures" button to begin the process and wait for it to finish. Ensure there are no red errors in the output window.</p>
        <h3>STEP 4.</h3>
        <p>That's it! Copy the subfolder from RENAMED to your emulator textures folder Eg. PCSX2/textures/SLUS-21214/replacements folder to test the uniform.</p>
        <h3>STEP 5.</h3>
        <p>Test the textures in-game using the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hPX-5ygg2k2SDtAkkI9PVbS0lbL-QCBs/edit#heading=h.inb40xudxrzt" target="_blank">TESTING ISO</a> to ensure everything is named properly and working as intended.</p>
        <h3><strong>DONE!</strong></h3>
        <br>
        <hr>

        <h2 id="mode2">INSTRUCTIONS (For Mode 2: Dumps Image Matching):</h2>
        <p>‚ö†Ô∏è Before you start: It's EXTREMELY important that you dumped your textures in a very specific way. Use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hPX-5ygg2k2SDtAkkI9PVbS0lbL-QCBs/edit#heading=h.inb40xudxrzt" target="_blank">DUMPING ISO</a>, and follow <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RI2ceiXVRgVu8H-POCee2n3O08iQxa_Q/" target="_blank">these instructions</a> closely and always remember to DELETE YOUR DUMPS between games! </p>
        <h3>STEP 1.</h3>
        <p>Provide the path to your "Dumps Folder Path". Click "Save Configuration".</p>
        <h3>STEP 2.</h3>
        <p>Define your configuration settings based on the uniform slot and uniform design you are making. Hover over the labels for instructions.</p>
        <h3>STEP 3.</h3>
        <p>Click the "Find Dumped Textures" button to begin the process and wait for it to finish. Ensure there are no red errors in the output window.</p>
        <h3>STEP 4.</h3>
        <p>ALMOST done! Now, dump the second glove texture...</p>
        <h3><strong>NEW: GLOVES!</strong></h3>
        <p>This tool now supports the new gloves mod. In this mod, each uniform uses two glove textures ‚Äì one texture for when the uniform is used while the home team and another textures for when used as the away team. Therefore, you must dump from a second game to get the second glove texture name/replacement. Instructions:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Important: Leave the initial run's uniform folder in RENAMED (the one you just made with the steps above). </li>
            <li>
              Then dump from another game where you are the opposite home/visitor team as the first time. So, if a dark uniform, be the visitor this time. If a light uniform, be the home team this time. 
              <br />
              <em>As with every game, be sure to <strong>delete your dumps (or the entire SLUS folder)</strong> when the game is loading!</em>
           </li>
            <li>Click the "Opposite Home/Away Glove" setting checkbox, and run the tool again by clicking the "Rename Source Textures" button. It will add another glove subfolder to your uniform's folder and append the CSV file with the second glove name.</li>
          </ol> 
        <h3>STEP 5.</h3>
        <p>That's it! Copy the newly created uniform's subfolder in RENAMED to your emulator textures folder Eg. PCSX2/texture/SLUS-21214/replacements folder to test the uniform.</p>
        <h3>STEP 6.</h3>
        <p>Test the textures in-game to ensure everything is named properly and working as intended.</p>
        <h3><strong>DONE!</strong></h3>
        <br>

        <h2 id="workflow">üß† Workflow Tip:</h2>
        <p>When making uniforms for multiple slots, I have found it easier and faster for my workflow to first create all of the CSV files (using the Mode 2: Dumps method with the "Don't rename" option enabled). Then ‚Äì¬†after organizing my textures into source folders for each uniform slot per <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cSh3Ibs306hGbgKI4rWpc2b8IlhgyKvP/edit?gid=2140522516#gid=2140522516" target="_blank">my planner</a> ‚Äì I will do the renaming of my custom textures with the CSVs and Mode 1: CSV Renaming.  </p>
        
        <p>I like this workflow because it allows me to get into more of a flow with the dumping process using the DUMPING ISO and not even worrying about testing and refining textures. When I've created all of the CSVs, I'll then switch to the TESTING ISO where I do the renaming and testing of my textures, which usually always involves making fixes and adjustments to textures. </p>

        <p>My rough workflow:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Open the <strong>DUMPING ISO</strong> (be sure to <strong>reset rosters</strong>, use no memory card, or have a specific memory card for dumping. The roster is important.) </li>
          <li>Choose "Play Now"</li>
          <li>Select team (same team for home and away)</li>
          <li>Edit stadium and <strong>change weather to cold</strong>.</li>
          <li>At the uniform select screen, <strong>SAVE A STATE</strong></li>
          <li>Select my uniforms and advance to the game. <strong>IMPORTANT!: DELETE DUMPS (or the entire SLUS folder) when the game is loading!</strong></li>
          <li>Press F9 twice to initiate dumping.</li>
          <li>Let the pregame intros run, do not skip it.</li>
          <li>While that's happening, in the Texture Renaming Utility, configure my uniform team, slot, and settings as needed.</li>
          <li>When the players run out for the coin toss, the dumps folder is ready. <strong>Enable the "Don't rename" checkbox</strong> (unless you are renaming your custom textures now) and <strong>Click "Find Dumped Textures"</strong>. If you get a green "SUCCESS" message in the output window, you're good and can skip the next step and proceed to step 12.</li>
          <li>If you get a red error message saying you're missing one or a few textures (Eg. only "29 of 30 required textures found"), don't worry, this is pretty common. Switch back to the emulator and run the kickoff and run a play from scrimmage. <strong>Click "Find Dumped Textures"</strong>. You should now get a green SUCCESS message. If not, scroll up and try to troubleshoot the issue and/or post in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/938236373113122826/1199737229220778016" target="_blank">Discord #texture-renaming-utility channel</a>. </li>
          <li>If SUCCESS, the first uniform is done! <strong>Change the slot to the opponent's uniform</strong>. </li>
          <li><strong>Click "Find Dumped Textures"</strong></li>
          <li>If SUCCESS, both uniforms for this game are done. <strong>LOAD THE STATE</strong> you saved in step 5. </li>
          <li>Select the next two uniforms, proceed to game. <strong>DELETE DUMPS</strong> (or the entire SLUS folder) when the game is loading</li>
          <li>Repeat steps 7 through 14 until you've completed all uniform slots.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Now you will have CSVs for all of your uniforms. Save these somewhere, and at any time you like you can very quickly use Mode 1: CSV Renaming to rename your custom uniform textures without having to do any dumping. </p>
