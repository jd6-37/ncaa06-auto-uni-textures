=== NCAA NEXT UNIFORM EXPANSION TEXTURE RENAMING UTILITY ===

This is the second generation of the batch renaming companion utility for the NCAA NEXT Uniform Expansion project. It will now automatically detect the proper texture names by looking at your dumps folder. You no longer need to track and provide the textures names!


INSTRUCTIONS:

STEP 1. Define the path to your dumps folder in the config.txt file.

STEP 2. Copy all of the exported PNG files from the TC Gear template into the "YOUR_TEXTURES_HERE" folder.

NOTE: Don't feel like you need to use the chinstrap from the TC Gear template. It's probably best to use a plain white one anyway, unless you see differently in reference photos. The default white one is in the 'default-textures' folder. If you want to use that, copy it into the 'put_exported_textures_in_here' folder and replace the chinstrap from the TC Gear export. Make sure it is named 'img22.png' or '22-Chinstrap.png'.

STEP 3. Put your other uniform pieces in the same folder. They must be named exactly as follows. The number shadows are automatically made transparent. No need to add those.

helmet.png
pants.png
jersey.png
pridesticker.png*
num07.png
num89.png
num07helmet.png*
num89helmet.png*
num07ss.png† 
num89ss.png† 

* if no replacement texture is provided, a transparent will be created automatically.

† if no replacement texture is provided, the script will use the main jersey numbers for the sleeve/shoulders (this is usually what you want)

STEP 4. Double-click the Auto-Rename-UniExp-Textures.exe file. It will compare the files in your dumps folder to the reference folder, detect which texture is which, and use those file names to rename your textures and put them into the RENAMED folder.

STEP 5. That's it! Rename the 'renamed' folder to the name of the uniform slot (Eg. home, away, alt01, alt02, etc.) and move it to your emulator textures/SLUS-21214/replacements folder to test the uniform.

STEP 6. Test the textures in your emulator to ensure all of the replacement textures are named properly and working as intended. PLEASE DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP!

STEP 7. If everything looks good and is working as expected, upload the home/away/alt01/etc folder to Google Drive. Be sure to put it in the correct team folder.

STEP 8. Post in the #files-to-merge channel the name of the team and uniform slot(s) you uploaded.

THANK YOU!
