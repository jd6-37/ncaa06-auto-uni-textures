# NCAA NEXT Texture Renaming Utility

This is the second generation of the batch renaming companion utility for the [NCAA NEXT](https://github.com/ncaanext/ncaa-next-24) Uniform Expansion project. It will automatically find the appropriate textures in your dumps folder by using various Python image processing libraries to compare a set of reference dumped textures to the files in the emulator's dumps folder. After finding the proper files names, it will then batch rename and organize your custom textures, as well as output the textures names to a CSV file.

Additionally, this utility can batch rename textures using a provided CSV file, bypassing the need for dumping textures again.
